### Ideas others use

- DataKind
  - Giving Tiers -- "a donation of this amount sponsors x"
  - Track time of volunteers to calculate the $'s people are contributing through their labor --> show the work is worth funding 


- Miami
  - Open Collective (kick-start-like) -- Maybe can combine with giving tiers
  - Can brigades lobby or collect for new brigade startup funds?

### Additional note
  - For whatever reason, we spoke about using our learning/working group designations and Christopher Whitaker went into more detail on how we can use the tags to signal to new people what the project needs are and if the project is appropriate for newer or more seasoned developers
  - The tags also indicate if the project is in need of additional developers
  - We can use more descriptive tags for our breakouts
