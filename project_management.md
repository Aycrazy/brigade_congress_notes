##-  Project Management

**SOMEONE TOOK AWESOME NOTES :)!**

### Framework Pt. 1
Team Roles (“MOCHA”)
- Manager: Assigns responsibility, holds owner accountable.
- Owner: Overall responsibility for success/failure of project. There should only be one owner
- Consulted: Should be asked for input or needs to be bought in to project
- Helper: Assists with or does some of the work
- Approver: Signs off on decisions before they’re final. May be manager, though might also be exec director, external partner, or board chair
e.g. 

<i>Manager - Member of “Project Familitation Committee”
Owner: Person who pitched and is most passionate about initiating/driving content direction
Consulted: Code for Milwaukee Core Team
Helper: Brigade members with dev skills
Approver: Owner, Helpers, Manager, or some subset of these</i>

### Discussion
- Have owner also be approver
- Where Manager also Owner, sometimes requires “intervention” to break up too much centralisation of responsibilities
- How appropriate is MOCHA model for brigade projects?
- Multiple owners of project, problem is lack of manager
- The model could offer insight on importance of having some project manager
- Collaborative approval
- Volunteer projects vs compensated work
- What role does the “partner” play?
- Available to consult and approve development in course of project
- Manager can issue helpful reminders but be wary of policing
- Structure breaks down when project is small team (e.g. 2 people)?
- These dynamics should be structured from beginning
- Should visions for projects be fixed? - What if volunteers offer skills that weren’t previously identified as “needed”?
- Project Management Institute (PMI) offers credit to volunteers +1!

### Framework Pt. 2
-Project Facilitation Checklist
- Link: bit.ly/31k6YUl
- Chi Hack Night
- Learning groups: May have no community partners, but be in process of understanding problems and potential projects
- Working groups: Project work

### Discussion
- Core system’s role in directly “managing” projects vs focusing on creating an ecosystem
- The former doesn’t scale
“What value are you providing to our partners?”
- Question to add to checklist?
- Is there a project out there already addressing this problem?
- Is this need already being met?
- Variation in different brigades’ exposure to tools
- Considering complex relationships and social issues that characterise social issues
- List of questions could help guide documentation
- These can often be very technical and tedious
- Unhelpful to newbies just learning, who might find it easier to navigate questions (Q&As)
- Need for schema by which to hold ourselves accountable
